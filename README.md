# Color hit

This game was made during the ["One Minute Game jam #5"](https://itch.io/jam/one-minute-game-jam-5)
In this short 2D shooter, you play as a kid in a tank who aims to color the world.
You can do that by either shooting paintballs all around or by moving around the map.
## Collectibles

There are some collectibles that spawns randomly on each map :
- bullets by stack of 3 or 10
- boxes, which can contain bonuses or penalties :
    - score: /2, x2, x4
    - speed: /2, x1.5, x2

Controls are simple:
- zqsd, wasd, or arrows to move
- left click to shoot
